# Text-to-SQL-LLM-App
The Text to SQL LLM App enables users to query SQL databases using natural language through the Gemini Pro model. Built with Streamlit, this application leverages LangChain for efficient SQL query generation and integrates libraries like PyPDF2, ChromaDB, and FAISS for enhanced data handling.
